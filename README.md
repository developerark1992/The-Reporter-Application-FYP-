## Final Year Project - Iqra University - Main Campus

## Admin Panel & Live Complaint System of The Reporter Application

## Intro

This project was built as a semester final project for FYP Course at Iqra University (Main-Campus). I spent several hours on this and studied plenty of documentation to build a seemless and efficient application. This app is  developed by me (Abdul Rehman Khan) and my Group members Mubashir Noor, Maaz Bin Rashid & Dhara Kumari and it mainly focuses on UI/UX standards of Norman and Schneiderman.

## The Reporter Portal

The Reporter is a complaint system where common citizens can complain about the authorities and the government officials, including ministers and beureucrats, then the concerned departments view these complaints and try to resolve them as soon as possible.
